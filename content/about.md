My name is Edward Gomez and I'm an astronomer.

## What I do during the day

Head over to my [profile website for more information](http://edward.gomez.me.uk) about me.

## Outside work

Until 2014 I was a proud member of Welsh Camerata - who enjoy singing Early Music in South Wales, under the effervescant direction of Andrew Wilson-Dickson. I also play the oboe, piano and try very hard not to make the lute sound too awful.

I'm Welsh and am currently trying to learn to speak welsh, having spent 37 years in Wales and only have an embarressing smattering of works. A big motivation behind this is being able to talk to people in welsh. In particular I would like to be able to talk to primary school kids about astronomy in welsh.

My beautiful wife is an astronomer too (she's a proper one - goes to Hawaii and everything). Have a look at her website to find out about her work in the origin of Cosmic Dust.

## Ps.

The name Dark Matter Sheep came from a podcast that I was writing about cosmology and the scary things in the Universe. The name of the episode was going to be - 'Do comologists dream of dark matter sheep?' to parody the Philip K. Dick novel, Do androids dream of electric sheep? (which was made into the, in some ways disappointing, film Blade Runner).
