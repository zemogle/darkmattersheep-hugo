<p>If you haven't met me then you probably don't have a good idea of what I would look like in person. Here is a pseudo 3D image of me taken by my friend <a href="http://jyardley.co.uk/">Jon.</a> Its a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereogram" target="_blank">stereogram </a>made up of 2 images (and me holding still in between). You need those red-blue cheapy 3D glasses that used to come free with comics when I was a kid (not the more advanced ones cinemas now boast in IMAX) to see the full effect.</p>

<p>If you start feeling a little motion sicknes - you're just being a baby.<br /><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.darkmattersheep.uk/2010/04/3DCamera_0000.jpeg"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-208 aligncenter" height="764" src="http://static.darkmattersheep.uk/2010/04/3DCamera_0000.jpeg" title="3DCamera_0000" width="561" /></a></p></p>
