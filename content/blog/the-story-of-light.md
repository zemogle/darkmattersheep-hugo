<p>On 22 March 2014, I gave a TEDxCardiff talk entitled "Intelligent Robots and the Story of Light". Being quite excited about being on stage again and being film, I didn't quite say everything I'd planned.</p>
<p>I believe that astronomy is a unique science because we are a limited to what we can learn about the Universe by the light that the Universe sends our way. Apart from travelling around our Solar System a little bit we can't visit anything in the Universe, say the closest star to the Sun - proxima Centauri, and &nbsp;dip a thermometer into it or put a ruler up against it. We rely on decyphering this information from the light that star shines in that direction. Everything &nbsp;we know about the Universe is from these tiny packets of information, from the afterglow of the Big Bang &nbsp;to cosmic fireworks when galaxies merge.</p>
<p>Each packet of information, each photon, has a story to tell and it is the job of astronomers to decypher that story.</p>
