<p>I was immensely proud to be asked to speak at <a href="http://tedxcardiff.co.uk/">TEDxCardiff </a>(a local branch of <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED</a>) earlier in 2014. Here is the video of my talk. I think it's come out rather well. I hope you get a sense of how much fun I was having!</p>
<p>It's on a similar theme to a lecture I gave a couple of years ago for <a href="http://www.rhysphillips.co.uk/pythagoras-trousers/">Pythagoras' Trousers</a> Lecture Series, called <a href="http://darkmattersheep.net/2012/10/telescopes-in-strange-places/">Telescopes in Strange places</a>. Although I blogged a transcript of that at the time, <a href="http://astronomerswithoutborders.org/gam-2014-blog/item/telescopes-in-exotic-places.html">I recently re-blogged it as part of Global Astronomy Month 2014</a>, run by Astronomers Without Borders.</p>
