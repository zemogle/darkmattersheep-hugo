<p>As residents of Cardiff, me and the wife love cycling to Cardiff Bay at the weekend. The route we choose is mostly alongside the River Taff, on a route called the <a href="http://www.tafftrail.org.uk/">Taff Trail</a> which runs from Brecon all the way down to Cardiff Bay (and the mouth of the river). We've only ever done the bit between Cardiff and <a href="http://www.cadw.wales.gov.uk/default.asp?id=6&amp;PlaceID=48">Castell Coch</a> which is about 1/6 of the total route, but the round trip is an easy 10 miles for a lazy Sunday afternoon. I'm not entirely sure our little <a href="http://www.brompton.co.uk/">Bromptons</a> (the kings of the folding bike world) would cope with the rougher terrain further north.</p>

<p>A few years ago I signed a petition for <a href="http://www.sustrans.org.uk/">Sustrans</a> (short for Sustainable Transport - a great organization that promotes the use of bikes) to get a bundle of lottery money to extend some cycle routes. I remember one of them was a bridge over the river Ely (a small less popular river which along with the Taff, feed Cardiff Bay and the Severn Estuary). It looks like after all this time the bridge is complete and last Sunday we thought we'd have a cycle across it from Cardiff to Penarth and back over the <a href="http://www.cardiffharbour.co.uk/harbour/barrage/barrage.html">Cardiff Bay barrage</a> into the Bay proper.</p>

<p>The image is kindly provided by <a href="http://www.opencyclemap.org/">Open Cycle Map</a> (if you want to find a cycle route anywhere in Europe, this is your first port of call - it is truly amazing!). I've added a blue dashed line to extend the other cycle paths (grey dashed).</p>

<p>Its a very easy cycle about 6 or 7 miles if you do the round trip from town and you don't have a big lunch (or there isn't a match on in the Millennium Stadium).</p>

<p>A couple of hints:<br /><ul><br />	<li>The Taff Trail ends a little bit short of the Bay in a rather unappealing road. You have to cross this road and look for a teeny tiny blue sticker on a lamppost to continue of the new, Bay route (winding to the left of a housing estate - its not as bad as it sounds!). If you get onto the road which passes the police station and with the unmistakable armadillo of <a href="http://www.wmc.org.uk">Wales Millennium Centre</a> ahead of you, you've gone the wrong way.</li><br />	<li>When you are on the Bay route, the signs are a often obscured so have your eagle eyes on. Below is an example of one. If a change of course happens there is a rather small arrow on the sign, if not carry on going.</li><br /></ul><br />[simage=18,max,n,center,]<br /><ul><br />	<li>Travel around the Penarth Marina and definitely go across the Cardiff Bay Barrage. If you're lucky there will be boats in the lock. Its really rather interesting, in a pleasantly nerdy way! (The image below is when the lock gates are up, not a scene from <a href="http://inceptionmovie.warnerbros.com/">Inception</a>)</li><br /></ul><br />[simage=20,max,n,center,]<br /><ul><br />	<li>When you get into the Bay, have a coffee in the <a href="http://www.assemblywales.org/sen-home/sen-about-senedd.htm">Senedd</a> (Welsh Assembly Senate building). It was very expensive to build, but since you paid for it enjoy the view! It looks like there is a strange tree in the middle but its all part of the environmental heating/cooling system.</li><br />	<li>Finally, travel past WMC (basking in the glory of the beautiful opera house) onto the little traffic island. There is a small cafe called <a href="http://www.kemis.co.uk/">Kemi's</a>. You must, must, must have lunch there. Kemi is not only an excellent cook, but one of the friendliest people you could meet. Plus her cafe has the best view across the bay</li><br /></ul><br />[simage=21,max,n,center,]</p>
