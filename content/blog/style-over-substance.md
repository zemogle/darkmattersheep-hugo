<p>Scientists who give unintelligible lectures, poorly designed research posters, and talks full of acronyms, equations and graphs with illegible axes are bad scientists.</p>
<h2>Bad Scientists</h2>
<p><br />The communication of science is one of the essential components of being a scientist, yet it is often the hardest to accomplish. Many senior professional scientists see the ability to give a good talk or lecture, having well laid out presentations, or creating an engaging poster about their scientific work as a "soft skill". As an academic in Cardiff University I attend exam boards and other meetings where many of my colleagues dismiss attempts to develop these transferable skills in our undergraduates. Last year I had an gigantic argument with a colleague (one whom I respect enormously and whose opinion I had previously considered very even-handed) who told me one of my students had "padded their research project talk with background" while his student had "delved straight into her research". The effect was that my student's talk was understood by all the other students and, more significantly, the whole panel, whereas his student's talk was completely impenetrable and only understood by her supervisor</p>
<p>There has been even more resistance towards a whole module dedicated to science communication in our school.</p>
<p>"Anyone who cannot explain their research to a moderately intelligent teenager is a charlatan" - Albert Einstein</p>
<p>When going to conferences we readily see the fruits of this attitude. Many talks are badly prepared and barely intelligible, rather like that of my colleagues student, only these people rejoice in giving bad talks. It's almost as if they consider giving a bad talk as a sign of intelligence. That they spent a so much time doing their important research, they didn't have time to waste on soft skills.</p>
<p>It's a real shame because many of these people are engaging speakers and good scientists but when they come to share their research they totally fail. One of the main tenants of science and they fail. That makes them bad scientists, in my books.</p>
<h2>Style and Substance</h2>
<p><br /><span style="line-height: 1.5;">For many years I have been a big fan of the work of David McCandless. His company, </span><a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/" style="line-height: 1.5;">Information is Beautiful</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">, produce eye-catching and provocative graphic art to illustrate datasets. Sometimes the topics datasets are very dry, like the UK spending on different budgetary items, but with a little graphic design magic, he makes the data look not only interesting but allows you to extra new insights from it. One of my recent favourites is the "</span><a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/the-bbc-o-gram/" style="line-height: 1.5;">BBC-o-gram</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">", an info-graphic showing the income and spending of the BBC annually (radio is really cheap!).</span></p>
<p>Recently I attended two outstanding conferences for people engaged in using astronomy for education and public engagement: <a href="http://unawe.org/events/workshop2013/">Universe Awareness 2013 workshop</a> (Heidelberg) and <a href="http://www.communicatingastronomy.org/cap2013/">Communicating Astronomy to the Public 2013</a> (Warsaw). Several astronomy projects take their visual impact seriously, particularly <a href="http://zooniverse.org">Zooniverse</a> and <a href="http://unawe.org">Universe Awareness</a>. &nbsp;They have<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;beautiful websites, with data visualisations and illustrations which have been constructed to a very high level by artists and graphic designers. At these conferences their talks and posters were well prepared, both in their clutter-free style and in the delivery (in the case of the talks).</span></p>
<p>An excellent example is the Citizen Science poster/infographic created by <a href="http://charlotteprovot.com/?page_id=4">Charlotte Provot</a> (graphic designer at Universe Awareness). I stole this poster from the CAP2013 conference and have it in my office now.</p>
<p>Other examples on the Universe Awareness website are the Universe in a Box handbook, Space Scoop and UNAWE student ambassador printed material.</p>
<p>You can look at any of the Zooniverse project websites for examples of attractive, intuitive web design. My favourites are Old Weather, Milky Way Project and Bat Detective.</p>
<h2>What can you do?</h2>
<p><br />Emily Lakdewala has written an excellent&nbsp;<a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2013/04040850-better-conference-talks.html">guide on how to give better astronomy talks</a>. I certainly won't duplicate her fine words here but I will just mention the&nbsp;2 main things I consider when writing a talk:</p>
<p></p>

<li>Who are your audience?</li>

<p></p>

<li>What do you want them to learn from your talk?</li>
