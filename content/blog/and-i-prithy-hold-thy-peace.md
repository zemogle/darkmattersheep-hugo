<p>I found this recording on my mac today and I thought you might like to hear it. Its my own voice multitracked. I was in a performance of <a href="http://darkmattersheep.net/2010/01/twelfth-night-i-dont-believe-it/">Twelfth Night</a> some years ago and this one of the incidental songs which Sir Toby Belch, Sir Andrew Aguecheek and Feste sing in a night of drunken revelry. Its a simple catch (a sort of round - think 'row row row your boat') by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Ravenscroft">Thomas Ravenscroft</a>, and is almost contemporary with Twelfth Night. Ravenscroft wrote quite a bit of music to the songs in Shakespeare's plays, but they very seldom are performed with the plays. They are not masterworks but are quite pretty.</p>
<p>I recorded it in about 10 mins while my wife was gossiping on the phone, so &nbsp;don't judge me too harshly!</p>
