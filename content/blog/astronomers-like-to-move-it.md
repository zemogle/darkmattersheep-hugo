<p>Most of us talk with our hands. I do. Particularly when I'm trying to explain a difficult concept in physics. The first, and most lasting, recollection that one of my best friends has of me is waving my hands around trying to explain some long forgotten point about astronomy.</p>

<p>Whilst editing some video for <a href="http://lcogt.net/teapotsfromspace">Teapots from Space</a>, my friend <a href="http://jyardley.co.uk">Jon</a> remarked that with the sound off the astronomers looked like they were dancing.....so on a rainy afternoon I explored that a bit more.</p>

<p>I am very sorry to draw your attention to flamboyant moves of Dr Chris North, <a href="http://orbitingfrog.com">Dr Rob Simpson</a>, Dr Pete Hargrave and <a href="http://telescoper.wordpress.com">Prof. Peter Coles</a>. Actually, I'm not. They are guilty as charged!</p>
