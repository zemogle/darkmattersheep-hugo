<p>I've had this merry little catch running through my head all week, and I just had enough time to do a multitrack recording of it. There is a cheeky little message hidden inside this 17th Century song about a girl having a lesson on a spinnet. Its a baroque keyboard instrument a bit like a little&nbsp;harpsichord, but you can 'shake' or wiggle your finger on the keys to produce vibrato.</p>
<p>It's by John Isham and called "When Celia was learning on the spinet, to play"</p>
