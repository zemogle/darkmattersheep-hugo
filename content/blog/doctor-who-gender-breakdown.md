+++

I'm a big [Doctor Who](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/) fan. I have been since it had crappy effects but gripping stories, in the 1980's. I want to identify with the main character, The Doctor, and big factor in that is how he treats others. Various regenerations have been condescending or arrogant, but he is a fundamentally good person. I particularly like how The Doctor promotes solving problems and resolving conflicts, non-violently, is unafraid of being clever, and celebrates the things that makes people different (currently the real World seems to be doing the opposite).

Since the current favourite for the new regeneration of The Doctor is female ([Phoebe Waller-Bridge](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3564817/?ref_=nmmi_mi_nm)), I was interested to see how the show runners, script writers, and casting directors saw the [gender breakdown of the characters in Doctor Who](http://www.zemogle.uk/doctorwho/). So I went through the credits of each episode, identified each character and the actor who played them, and categorised their gender, as follows:

- <span class="cell-M">Male: </span>Characters who are clearly male, e.g. The Doctor, are referred to in the programme as 'he'.
- <span class="cell-F">Female: </span>Characters who are clearly female, e.g. Donna Noble, are referred to in the programme as 'she'. Robots which are intended to be female (e.g. the [Bad Wolf](http://www.zemogle.uk/doctorwho/#season1) characters Anne Droid, Davina droid are counted as female).
- <span class="cell-O">Other/Diverse: </span>Characters who do not have a definite gender, e.g. Daleks, Judoon, and are referred to in the programme as 'it'. If a computer has a female voice is it still and 'it'. Also characters who transgender who would be referred to as 'they', e.g. Lady Cassandra O'Brian.&Delta;17.

Have a look at the [Doctor Who Gender Breakdown](http://www.zemogle.uk/doctorwho/) for yourself. Here some of my thoughts.

## Initial thoughts
- In no season does the percentage of female characters reach beyond 40%.
- Every Russel T Davies season had better diversity than even the most diverse season of Steven Moffat's run (Season 6), which only has 2 episodes with more female than male characters (and only then if you count the 'interface' in _The Girl Who Waited_ as female).

## Russell T Davies years (2005-2008)
- The only 2 episodes of Season 1 have either equal or predominantly female casts (_Father's Day_ and _Bad Wolf_). In _Bad Wolf_ if you discount robots, it is male dominated.
- Season 2 has 2 episodes with predominantly female cast (_New Earth_ and _Love &amp; Monsters_) and 1 with equal numbers of male and female (_The Girl in the Fireplace_).
- Season 3 also has 2 predominantly female episodes (_Gridlock_ and _42_).
- Season 4 is an extra long (19 episodes) containing 2 Christmas Specials, the David Tennent Specials and a mini-episode. It is also the most diverse season with 7 episodes that have more female cast members than male (_Partners in Crime_, _Turn Left_, _The Stolen Earth_, _Journey's End_, _The End of Time: Part 1 &amp; 2_ and _A Ghost Story for Christmas_).

## Steven Moffat years (2008-2017)
- Season 5 starts off well for Moffat with 3 diverse episodes (_The Vampires of Venice_, _The Big Bang_ and _The Eleventh Hour_ - which has equality for male and female).
- _Closing time_ and _The Girl Who Waited_ are the predominantly female episodes of Season 5.
- _The Crimson Horror_ is the only predominantly female episode of Season 7. The awesomeness of Diana Rigg isn't enough to cover up for this season also having an all time low of only 1 female cast member (Clara Oswald) in _Cold War_.
- Even though there is the (in my opinion) genius casting as Michelle Gomez and The Master/Mistress, Season 8 only has 1 episode with a larger female cast than male, _In the Forest of the Night_.
- In Season 9 _The Zygon Invasion_ has one of the largest female casts in any season, nearly 3 x more than the male cast. There are 2 other episodes with a high female/male cast ratio, _Sleep No More_ and _Face the Raven_.
- Season 10 hasn't started well with _The Return of Doctor Mysterio_ having nearly 5 times more male characters than female. Looking at the current line up of episodes on _The Pilot_ has a higher female/male character ratio.


## Summary
Only 22 episodes had more female than male characters, with a further 5 having a balanced cast, out of a total of 142 episodes.

These figures although far from equal, are not the worst amongst sci-fi TV series and films. I had hoped that for a TV series which has endured so long and has so many progressive, diverse and inclusive story lines that this balance would be more equal. Maybe [Chris Chibnall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Chibnall) will redress this when he takes over from Steven Moffat in 2018.
