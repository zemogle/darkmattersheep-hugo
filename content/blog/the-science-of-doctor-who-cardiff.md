<p>As I've said before, I am a massive Doctor Who fan. In September 2014 I was delighted to be invited to St Louis, MO, to give my first <a href="http://darkmattersheep.net/blog/the-science-of-doctor-who/">Science of Doctor Who</a> talk (about space travel and alien worlds). Yesterday I was lucky enough to be asked to give a similar talk in my home town of Cardiff. I was so pleased not only because I'm from Cardiff, but also because Doctor Who is made in Cardiff studios. In fact many <a href="http://www.doctorwholocations.net/">locations around Cardiff</a> are used in the TV programme.</p>
