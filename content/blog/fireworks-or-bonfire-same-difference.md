<p><p>I have a nostalgic view of fireworks, especially the annual display in Bute Park. I can remember going there with elderly relatives in mittens, wanting to go so close to the bonfire that it melted the candy floss I had persuaded them to buy. This year was completely difference.</p><br /><p>Four of us walked down to the park and pretty soon could hear a disturbance. Was it antisocial prols listening to their car stereo too loudly or having an obscenely roucus party? Not the least of it. It was coming from the park.</p><br /><p>Gone was all form of innocence (admittedly the ritual does mark the burning of some naughty Catholics, so its not <b>that</b> innocent to start with). We were herded about 2 miles out of our way, into the park, where we were assaulted by fellow firework-goers umbrellas; call me old fashioned, but a child under 4" should not have an umbrella. I don't know how many times a small child ran into me with umbrella spokes, then looked up as is I'd grabbed the offensive object and rammed it up my own nose.</p><br /><p>I was surprised and a little mystified to see a large stage covering one of the Blackwier pitches, with some talentless flloozies trolling up and down it. I am still unsure why the Can-Can tune kept appearing....maybe I imagined it.</p><br /><p><img height="500" src="/files/2372841577_83e21cede3.jpg" style="float: left;" width="375" />I was very surprised to hear one of the appallingly bad compares mumble an introduction to Same Difference. Thinking I had misheard, I look up at the stage, and there they were - camp, cheeze. We love it!</p><br /><p>Same Difference have a new single coming out at the end of November (pick yourselves off the floor, and have a large G&amp;T). They announced it is called 'We are one', one of the friends I was with added 'I don't know about her, but he's definitely<i> one</i>!'. After that comment, everything else was very disappointing, especially the fireworks.</p><br /><p>The only option to recover was champagne cocktails and games of bridge into the wee hours.</p><br /><p>Cardiff Fireworks verdict: Pay your neighbour 7 pounds to make their dog sick. It will be more spectacular and probably more colourful.</p></p>
