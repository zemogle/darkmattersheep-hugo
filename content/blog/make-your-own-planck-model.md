<p>I love making <a href="/2011/02/a-lapse-in-concentration/">time-lapse films</a>, so I've done another one. <a href="http://strudel.org.uk">Stuart</a> has made a very nice Planck model, so we thought a quick explanation of how to assemble it would be the perfect accompaniment. I'm behind the camera and you can see Stuart's hands doing the work.</p>

<p>You can get your hands on the model from the <a href="http://plancktelescope.org.uk">UK Planck outreach site</a> or from Stuart's flickr feed (specifically, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/5508919509/">page 1</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/astronomyblog/5508919785/">page 2</a>). I used<a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/"> iMovie '11</a> to do the video editing - it was remarkably easy!</p>
