Hello!

My name's Jack. And I'm pretty excited today. Guess why!

It's my birthday!

It is literally my birth day. Before today, I didn't exist.

And do you know, it's been non-stop here. Seems like it's a lot of other folks' birthdays too. All my new cousins are really friendly, but we don't get much time to interact because they're always flying off somewhere.  It's been like a really busy fiesta or firework night. It's really crowded here, and really hot. But I suppose that's only to be expected, when you're a tiny packet of light, living in the centre of a star.

Did I mention it's crowded here? Wow - Not only are our houses really close but when I'm outside I can barely see the nose at the end of my face. Well, I don't really have a nose. Or a face, but you get the idea.

I call them houses but they're basically just protons. I haven't seen an electron yet. It's really hot too. Did I mention that?

I’m going to have to go, I think some of my cousins are waiting for me. See you in a bit.

## --

So, something really strange happened the other day. I was out with my cousins again, as normal, just messing around, diving into each other's houses. You won't believe this but when I came out of my cousin Millie's house. I was a different colour! It was amazing, I felt so much more powerful. It was weird and exhilarating all at once. Millie said it was because of Quantum Mechanics, which she says is how we photons live our lives, but I like to think it's because I'm growing up.

Now, I can't tell you, what colour I am because you don't have a word for it, but it was a pretty big deal for me, I can tell you.

Oh, I meant to say, things have settled down a bit at home. It's much less busy since we moved. I've been living in a new proton for the last 10,000 years, not far from the core of the star but far enough away from the night life that I get a bit of piece and quiet. There are fewer photons going past, knocking on our door.

By the way, I still haven't seen an electron. Millie says they exist but I reckon she's just teasing me.

I'll let you know if one ever turns up.

## --

WOAH! You'll never believe this. I got upgraded!

I was out with Millie again. Dipping in and out of our cousin's houses. Changing colour. She's really good at it, by the way. She knows just by looking at a proton what it's energy state is, and what colours are available. She's still saying its all to do with electrons but she might as well say it's a magical unicorn that’s granting her wishes, because I've never seen one.

Anyway. I got home and you'll never guess what. My house was bigger! I mean really big. It's slightly more than four times bigger. It turns out that we were due for an upgrade and our old friend the Quantum Mechanics lottery made it happen! It's almost totally random but I'm not complaining. Millie says, our single proton house was called a Hydrogen ion. Now we have 2 protons, and check this out, 2 neutrons too. It's called a Helium ion. I've gone from a studio apartment to a beautiful 6 up, 6 down house.

That was a Quark joke, by the way.

And if you like jokes... An atom walks into a bar, hits her head, and says "I think I just lost an electron". The barmaid says "Are you sure?". The atom says "Yes. I'm positive"!

Its funny because an electron's negatively charged... Yeah. I don't believe they exist either.

I'll see you later.

I've been in this old star for a couple of millions years and today something really sad happened. Something that changed my whole world. Millie and I were messing about close to the star's surface. We had a game which was to jump in and out of ions as close to the surface as possible. We do this over and over, for hundreds of years.

Millie said she was going to be the winner. She was going to find an ion so close to the surface, when she dived back out, she would just skim the surface of The Star.

But she totally misjudged it. She was about to jump into a little Hydrogen ion but a huge Carbon ion got in the way. I waited and waited for her to come back out. It seemed to take forever. Then finally it happened but the Carbon was facing the wrong way, out towards space. Millie was just beamed out into the black void, away from the star.

Away from me.

I saw an electron today too. It was beautiful. It was like when you see something out of the corner of your eye but when you look directly at it, it's gone. I realised that they had been there all the time. Millie had been right. Electrons aren't like protons or neutrons at all. They're simultaneously tiny, and spread over vast areas.

The only reason we could jump into ions was because they were connected to these beautiful things we couldn't really see.

I really miss Millie.

## --

Ok, Something really weird is happening here. The star is swelling and shrinking, in a really alarming way. There is a whole load more Heliums, Carbons and other funky looking things floating around too. I've been back into the middle of the star and back out towards the surface a couple of times and it's all going crazy in there.

So, I’ve made a big decision.

I'm leaving. I'm going to do it just like Millie did. Jump into a nice big ion. Get blasted into space. I'm ready.

I'll see you on the other side...if I make it.

## --

I made it!

I know I was a bit anxious about taking the plunge but I'm flipping glad I did. Just after I left, all hell broke loose.

It turns out the star was completely emotionally unstable. Literally a hot mess and it just went crazy. Bloating and slimming down, over and over.

Then it just snapped. Blew itself inside out, showered all my cousins and all the ions out into space with me.

Yeah. Who knew‽

The weird thing is, when it did that, it made a whole load more photons AND a load more ions. Some really strange looking ones and some that stayed around for a bit then changed into smaller, stranger looking ones. I'm glad none of them was MY house. I would have been Royally peeved if I just took ownership of a new Nickel mansion and in the blink of an eye it's changed to crumby Iron bedsit.

There were also loads of things that looked a bit like me, shooting out from the star too. They were a bit thicker than me and all my cousins, but still were pretty fast, like us. I heard someone call them neutrinos but they look like photon wannabes to me.

It was quite breath-taking though. Millie would have loved it.

Anyway. It is totally different out here in the great void. For the first time in my life, I feel free. I'm just going and going and it feels like nothing can stop me. It was really liberating just leaving everything behind. No baggage to hold me back.

Do you know why I don't have any baggage? Because, I'm travelling light!

A tiny packet of light, travelling in a straight line. That's what I do now. None of this jumping between ions. I'm just heading out on an adventure.  I can see a big group of galaxies straight ahead. Each of them has hundreds of billions of shining balls that are a bit like The Star. I can’t wait to see what that’s all about.

Every hundred years, or so, I look back at what's left of the star. It's even more beautiful than I thought it could be.

Its really interesting to see dark clumps forming out of the debris. That's something totally new. These clumps are actually blocking my view of the remains of the star. I can see loads of my fellow photons make permanent homes there too.

They don't just jump in and out of these dust clouds, they hang around there making them hot and bothered. Then, and this is the really funny part, the dust cloud starts making its own photons. They are a totally different colour to my cousins from the star too.

I like it. It's like a colony or another generation or something.

Well, since this cosmic cruise control is engaged, I’m going to have a little snooze. Wake me up if anything interesting happens.

## --

Do you feel that? It's really subtle but something is not right. I'm travelling in a nice straight line, you remember, that's what I do now. But the view ahead is a bit different. It looks like I’m not going towards that big group of galaxies after all.

Now I know I haven’t changed direction and since there is nothing else out here, it must be that space isn’t as uniform as I thought.  Its like the road has gradually been curving to one side, around these galaxies.

I remember Millie saying something about gravity.

What was it?..Something like: space tells things how to move, but things themselves tell space how to curve.

I guess that’s what happened to me. Those galaxies must have curved space, so I’m not moving where I thought!

I told you I was on an adventure!

I’ll keep you posted about where I end up, but for now I think I’m going have another snooze.

## --

*Yawn* Sorry, about that. I must have slept longer than I meant to. I’ve been feeling so tired recently. I just don't seem to have the energy I used to. I was beginning to think there was something wrong with me.

But no! It was all part of this cosmic adventure!

I realised that my colour has been changing again. But not in the same way as in The Star. Then my colour would totally change by jumping out of an ion.

What I didn’t notice out here, was that my colour has been *gradually* changing. Its been happening ever since I made that big leap off The Star’s surface and into the black void of space. I’m redder than I used to be.

I think it suits me, its more ... distinguished!

It took me ages to work out whats been going on, then I realised it. I’m actually taller! A taller and more distinguished adventurer. Once again the Universe had a couple of tricks up its sleeve for us cosmic explorers. *I* haven’t actually grown. The rest of space has grown. Obviously.

I know that sounds like I’ve made it up to cover my secret eating habit but its true. Pinkie promise. I’m taller because the Universe is growing, the space between my top and my bottom has been getting bigger.

I checked by looking back at that big group of galaxies I was heading towards. I passed them a couple of million years ago, and they are definitely looking more red now, as well.

I’m heading towards another galaxy now. This one has four beautiful arms spiralling out from the centre. I can see a yellowish star about half way along one of those arms, and I’m heading right for it.

I wonder if it will look like My Star.

I’ll let you know when I get a bit closer.

## --

Ok. I’m quite close to that yellowish star now, and you will never believe this. I’m just zooming along, going in a straight line, minding my own business and when I looked to the side. I saw another photon just like me.

It was Millie!

Now we photons are the fastest things in the Universe but we only have one speed out here in space. So you’re thinking how have I met up with Millie, when she left The Star hundreds of years before me and in a different direction.

Well, you remember that group of galaxies that I swerved around? Millie was heading towards them too, except she went the other side of them. She actually swerved around another little group of galaxies, so her journey was much longer than mine.

Anyway, now we’re both heading towards a big lump of rock just to the left of the yellow star. We’ll be there in about 4 or 5 years. I can’t wait! I’m so excited.

Best day ever!

## --

Right, things are getting serious now. Millie and I are heading down onto this blue-green rock. Its actually quite big. Not as big as this yellow star and certainly not as big as our star, but not small. We’re coming down on the green part not the blue part. Millie says its called a planet. I don’t care what its called, its coming at me pretty damn fast.

As we’re getting closer, the duvet of gas surrounding this planet makes us go all wobbly. It tickles which is a totally new and quite a nice feeling. I look at Millie and she’s definitely twinkling.

We’re going to hit the planet right smack on a big tube of metal and glass, high up on a mountain.

Millie says its called a telescope. I don’t know how she knows these things.

We squeeze into the end of the tube. We bounce around between bits of glass, get stretched, squashed and finally we are slurped up by an electrical bucket. It records everything about us, digitising us.

We now exist but don’t exist, well not as photons anyway. We’re purely information, digitally recorded. We can see the impressions of other photons that we knew from the The Star, also digitally recorded.

Together all of us make up a picture of The Star: before, during and after it blew itself apart. A blue star in a galaxy, which should have been hidden behind a group of galaxies, on the other side of the Universe.

Any time someone wants to know what happened to The Star, and about the exciting journey we had getting here, Millie and I are here to tell that story.

Millie and Jack. Apart for millions of years and now right next to each other.

Always together.

Telling the story of our awesome adventure.
