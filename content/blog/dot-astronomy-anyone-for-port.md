<p>I am not a drinker. It is true. I very rarely drink mid-week but whilst in the Netherlands at the marvellous .astronomy conference, I drank rather a lot. I'm not saying an excessive amount in any one sitting, that would just be antisocial. I reserve that sort of behaviour for family occasions.</p>

<p>The Netherlands is very close to Belgium and therefore very close to potent supply of fine beer, served in comedic glasses. Every night, I tried very hard to have just one small beer. I have to say that had some of the most interesting science conversations over a quiet beer. One night something significant happened. A good friend of mine, Douglas Pierce-Price, made the quite brilliant suggestion that a glass of port would finish the evening off nicely. Which it did.</p>

<p>The following night was the conference dinner. I was quite amazed by the number of sex shops that we passed on the way there. We had to ask for directions underneath a lamp post, directly outside one with cheeky slogans. Well, we didn't have to but we did. The dinner was in an architecturally reclaimed warehouse type building, which is now a classy restaurant.  The beef was a bit rare but we were on the Continent.</p>

<p>When we were asked for our selection of coffee Douglas and I cheekily asked the waiter for some port. We were pleasantly surprised to be presented with a knowledgeable chap who chatted palatably niceties of a nutty tawny or a fruity ruby. We plumbed for one of each.<br /><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://darkmattersheep.wordpress.com/files/2009/12/dscf1957.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18" height="200" src="http://darkmattersheep.wordpress.com/files/2009/12/dscf1957.jpg?w=300" title="Cheers!" width="300" /></a></p><br />This was a very popular decision and about half of the other attendees followed suit and grabbed a manly glass of the crimson gold. Chris Lintott promised me a port hangover if .astronomy were to go to Oxford!</p>

<p>On Friday night we flew back to Cardiff airport where we were met by a sign that made me a little worried. Did people often take to port a little too freely when abroad?</p>
