I'm very happy to have a graphic designer friend, [Charlotte Provot](http://charlotteprovot.com), who likes space. She has kindly designed me a new logo for this blog. Her brief was to make it look like a 1980s computer game. I'm really pleased with the result.

Here is a full size version, in all its glory.
