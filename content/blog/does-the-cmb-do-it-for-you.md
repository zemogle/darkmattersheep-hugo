<p>In <a href="http://www.cf.ac.uk">Cardiff University</a> we teach a Physics degree and an Astrophysics degree (and actually a degree which is half way in between). The 'physics' cohort of students are always asking me why they need to know about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation">Cosmic Microwave Background</a>. So I've made a poll to see if it is just me that thinks all phys/astro students should know about it because it is fairly fundamental physics.</p>

<p><!--more-->If you don't have the sort of enquiring mind that wants (just a little bit) to know how the Universe formed and what its made of, you're not a very dedicated physicist, in my opinion.</p>

<p>If the poll below does not work, have a look at <a href="http://twtpoll.com/03h8xc">http://twtpoll.com/03h8xc</a></p>
